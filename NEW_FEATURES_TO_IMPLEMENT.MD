# Chunking for Trancription
- Implement chunking for transcription to handle long audio files.
- For files longer than 5 minutes, the audio should be split into chunks of 5 minutes.
- Chunks should be transcribed separately, and the results should be combined into a single transcript.
- The diarisation should run on the entire audio file, not on chunks.
- The combined transcript object should be tagged with the speaker ID from the diarisation.

# Speaker Identification
- Implement speaker identification to classify speakers in the audio file.
- Speaker IDs should be linked to speaker names.
