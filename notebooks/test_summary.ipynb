      "\\n\\n=== File 1: Critical Role plays Daggerheart ï½œ Live One-Shot ï½œ Open Beta_chunk_4_300_seconds (t=0.0s) ===\\n[0.2s - 2.6s] Expect a lot of rad stuff to come in the future.\\n[3.6s - 4.5s] We're super excited.\\n[4.7s -

67.5s] And then there's also a character building video with Travis and Matt where they create Bertrand Bell in Dagger Heart.\\n[71.5s - 80.2s] We also uploaded our session zero for this one shot that we are about to play right now where we created these delightful characters you're about to see.\\n[80.4s - 89.5s] So if you want a little bit more insight into how the session zeros work, you can go check it out and see how much of how bad shit we all are.\\n[90.0s - 91.4s] The VOD for tonight.\\n[91.9s -

110.1s] I need a little bit of a test.\\n[110.2s - 111.6s] Get on the newspaper.\\n[113.5s - 113.8s] Damn it.\\n[114.3s - 116.2s] Here, I'll show you my New York Times app.\\n[119.9s - 120.6s] Regardless.\\n[121.5s - 122.4s] How do we prove it?\\n[122.6s - 123.4s] What happened today?\\n[123.6s - 124.5s] This is today's murder.\\n[124.6s - 125.1s] Oh, that's cool.\\n[125.3s - 125.8s] Let's go live.\\n[125.8s - 126.2s] Live, live.\\n[126.2s -

136.5s] So, yeah, excited to do this.\\n[137.0s - 139.5s] You know, this is still a newish rule set for us as well.\\n[139.6s - 141.6s] We played a number of games and things have changed many times.\\n[141.8s - 145.6s] So if we ever get loosened goosey with it, just know that we're also testing it alongside you.\\n[146.2s - 149.6s] But nonetheless, I believe that concludes our announcements.\\n[149.8s - 156.1s] So let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role, Please Dagger Ho.\\n[161.1s - 163.2s] We don't have the opening titles, so now we just go into the outside.\\n[166.2s - 166.8s] Perfect.\\n[168.6s - 175.0s] So, welcome, one and all, to the realm of Loch Spire.\\n[175.6s - 190.1s] A rolling collection of winding land masses that tumble from the mountains of creation into the surrounding seas that coil between the broken expanse of grassy hills, rocky crags, and mysterious overgrowth from the length of the Builder's Bridge to the distant ruins of Nyx.\\n[191.0s - 201.7s] Here beneath the hollows above, mortals mingle with the great many relics and ruins of ages long past, now left to crumble beneath ambition and progress.\\n[202.0s - 213.8s] Here, the echoes of traumatic wars linger in unhealing scars that stretch the land, while remnants of vibrant and magical beings dance between the sunbeams and ancient places of thrumming power.\\n[214.7s - 221.0s] Here, the common folk seek revelry and purpose in a world that churns in a constant state of change.\\n[221.4s - 224.3s] Fortune and glory ever call to many.\\n[225.0s - 233.0s] And life in Loch Spire is rarely dull for those with an eye for opportunity and an eagerness to walk beyond what is comfortable.\\n[233.7s - 246.2s] Even so, older and crueler wills lurk within the depth of every shadow and in the twisted heart of every city, even within the most sacred of natural places.\\n[246.9s - 249.9s] And it is here where our story begins.\\n[250.2s - 264.7s] In the late afternoon of a late summer day, within a moss-dappled cabin nestled within the outskirts of the divine Timberland known as the Emerald Sky, home to the will of Andra, goddess of the wild and wooded places.\\n[265.7s - 280.4s] Here among the ever-climbing perimeter trees, within the home of the retired war hero Everett Cole, a troop of journeyman adventurers, bonded through circumstance, finish their last meal before trekking into the ominous deep of the Emerald Sky.\\n[280.7s - 296.1s] As we come in into the late afternoon, kind of golds and greens of the forest, past the kind of moss and dust-covered exterior window, we see the warmly lit interior of the humble cabin, the flames crackling in the nearby fireplace.\\n[296.6s - 298.4s] We shift over to.\\n\\n\\n=== File 2: Critical Role plays Daggerheart ï½œ Live One-Shot ï½œ Open Beta_chunk_5_300_seconds (t=298.4s) ===\\n[298.6s - 302.7s] Sir Dante, if you wouldn't mind describing me what you look like and what you are doing within the cabin.\\n[303.0s - 303.9s] Oh, my God.\\n[304.4s - 304.8s] You're real good.\\n[305.2s - 305.4s] Oh my God.\\n[307.0s - 307.5s] Not bad.\\n[308.8s - 313.8s] Well, I am a approximately 5'10 turtle.\\n[315.2s - 319.2s] Wearing a Corsair's hat in brown leather with a lovely feather on top.\\n[319.8s - 326.6s] A blue and white striped tunic and a half cape of royal gold, gold and royal blue.\\n[327.1s - 331.7s] Leather gloves, leather boots, although the toes cut out because turtle.\\n[332.7s - 333.4s] I mean, of course.\\n[333.7s - 339.1s] I have a very fancy rapier and a chained weapon of some kind with a claw on it.\\n[339.3s - 342.1s] And at the moment, I am attempting to...\\n[342.5s - 347.8s] Oh, I also have a scar on my face, just a little one of those, just something for some character.\\n[348.5s - 355.6s] And I'm at the moment using my hat to fan the fire to just see if we can get it a bit warmer in here.\\n[356.2s - 360.2s] As the smoke kind of billows out from your hat movement, it kind of fills that space a bit.\\n[360.2s - 364.3s] And you hear the sound of the coffee of Everett Cole.\\n[364.4s - 378.5s] You see the older human in his 60s, kind of a shaggy skullet on weathered skin, deeply kind eyes that are almost hidden within a wrinkled brow that has now kind of overtaken most of the front face, but a warm smile as he turns to you, Coughing.\\n[380.3s - 383.5s] Hell, I appreciate your help there, sure, turtle.\\n[384.0s - 385.2s] The fire's broken.\\n[385.8s - 386.1s] Which.\\n[386.7s - 387.4s] It'll be fine.\\n[388.2s - 390.6s] Let me handle the rest of the tea.\\n[390.7s - 392.0s] You all just relax a minute.\\n[392.2s - 392.6s] Now what?\\n[393.7s - 395.4s] I'm just curious about you all.\\n[398.0s - 399.4s] You there, big fella.\\n[399.6s - 405.8s] I'm sorry, the accommodations are quite to your scale as we shift over to see Pango.\\n[406.1s - 406.3s] Hello.\\n[406.7s - 407.0s] Hi.\\n[407.1s - 408.5s] Yes, I'm Pango.\\n[409.5s - 411.0s] I am very tall.\\n[411.3s - 413.0s] I don't really know heights too well.\\n[413.3s - 415.0s] It's either seven or eight feet.\\n[415.8s - 419.0s] My feet are bigger than yours, so I don't know how that factors in.\\n[420.3s - 426.8s] But I'm big, and I kind of squint when I'm outside a lot because I'm not used to being outside.\\n[427.1s - 429.0s] I grew up underground.\\n[430.0s - 435.9s] And now I'm out and traveling with my friends and having a grand old time.\\n[436.3s - 455.7s] You might also notice that most of my purplish skin is covered up with some armor, but which is also tastefully covered up with some very green and very fancy duds that my friends Sweet Pea and Oppie stole for me in the next last town over.\\n[456.0s - 457.7s] I'm looking pretty fresh.\\n[458.1s - 459.2s] They say I look fresh.\\n[459.3s - 461.1s] I don't know what that means, but it's...\\n[462.2s - 469.0s] And right now I'm just sort of staring over Zarlo's plate, just wondering if he's going to finish all of it, because it looks...\\n[469.8s - 470.4s] I need more.\\n[470.7s - 471.9s] How about it, you dry shite?\\n[472.1s - 473.0s] Are you hungry, Stan?\\n[473.7s - 474.2s] Oh, my God.\\n[474.6s - 477.8s] I mean, I don't want to impose, but like, I could, yeah, I could, I could eat.\\n[478.2s - 479.3s] I can make plenty of biscuits.\\n[479.5s - 480.0s] That's what you need.\\n[480.5s - 480.9s] He is big.\\n[481.1s - 483.6s] If that fecker fell over, he'd be halfway home.\\n[484.2s - 487.8s] Well, happy to get you a bit of food as well, I suppose.\\n[488.2s - 490.0s] Whatever brings all your up.\\n[490.2s - 490.9s] I'm a fecker?\\n[491.0s - 491.8s] Does that mean I feck?\\n[493.6s - 498.6s] What my grandfather always used to say to me is, Zardo, don't say fucker, it's not polite, say fecker instead.\\n[498.9s - 499.7s] Oh, okay.\\n[500.0s - 500.5s] I'll use that.\\n[500.7s - 501.6s] Sort of a cheat.\\n[502.2s - 502.9s] I've learned that.\\n[503.0s - 504.5s] All right, Fecker, writing that down.\\n[504.6s - 508.6s] As he goes and walks over to his bookcase, as you kind of sit back and cross your arms with confidence.\\n[509.3s - 510.3s] What does Zarlo look like?\\n[510.6s - 514.6s] Well, Zarlo is sort of the elder statesman of this group, even though he's not that old.\\n[514.9s - 520.2s] He's been with the larger organization our people have been with, this group has been with for quite some time.\\n[520.6s - 523.8s] And while not a mentor per se, sometimes he has to be a bit of a babysitter.\\n[524.0s - 525.0s] They get into trouble a lot.\\n[525.9s - 527.5s] Zarlo is about four feet tall.\\n[527.6s - 528.3s] He's a simia.\\n[529.4s - 530.5s] Lots of brown fur.\\n[530.9s - 534.8s] He has a very regal twined mustache down the sides of his face.\\n[535.0s - 538.5s] A little bit scruff of a beard, and there's a shock of white in his brown hair.\\n[538.7s - 543.8s] He has an always active tail that is as communicative as his hands tend to be.\\n[544.2s - 551.4s] And he is wearing like Burning Man pants and a pair of sashes going diagonally across his chest holding.\\n[551.7s - 552.6s] Yeah, it looks like that.\\n[553.2s - 555.0s] They're all arrested to bring you.\\n[555.6s - 557.6s] A lot of people have Burning Man pants or no pants.\\n[558.1s - 558.5s] Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\n[559.4s - 559.9s] Donald Douglas.\\n[560.9s - 562.8s] Sometimes it is those pants, but not today.\\n[563.8s - 564.7s] Look at the trees, though.\\n[565.4s - 572.3s] By the way, I am also perching to be in character like a monkey, but I feel like I might fire at any minute.\\n[572.6s - 574.6s] But I'm living on the edge and I'm going to do it anyway.\\n[578.2s - 578.8s] We're in the background.\\n[584.1s - 584.6s] I'm good for now.\\n[587.4s - 592.2s] And his cheeks are a little red right now because he's probably had one or two too many today.\\n[592.6s - 593.0s] Fair enough.\\n[594.3s - 598.2s] Oh, this is certainly quite the mildly.\\n\\n\\n=== File 3: Critical Role plays Daggerheart ï½œ Live One-Shot ï½œ Open Beta_chunk_6_300_seconds (t=598.2s) ===\\n[598.3s - 599.2s] Crew have stumbled in.\\n[599.3s - 601.0s] I don't get many visitors around here.\\n[601.4s - 603.0s] I'm happy to gauge y'all.\\n[603.1s - 610.2s] You said you came out from Ford Overmarch, right about 15, 20 miles south of here.\\n[611.2s - 614.8s] Pray tell what brings you this side of the Emerald Sky.\\n[615.8s - 623.0s] He glances over towards the regal-looking beetle figure who's been stoically standing, staring into the flames.\\n[633.2s - 634.7s] Slap on the rush of the dark.\\n[635.0s - 636.0s] So regal.\\n[636.3s - 637.0s] Oh my god.\\n[638.0s - 639.4s] Sorry, the smoke's getting to you too.\\n[639.5s - 640.2s] Here, some more tea.\\n[641.3s - 646.4s] And he comes up and hands you a hefty mug of hot, steaming tea.\\n[648.2s - 652.1s] Kexen is standing there holding on to his staff.\\n[652.6s - 663.8s] He has a hard shell that's got blues and purples in it, kind of shiny with lighter, bluish-green eyes and large mandibles pointing out from his face, very much like a stag beetle.\\n[664.3s - 670.6s] He has some kick-ass, like armored pauldrons with points just for flaring, maybe a little bit of protection.\\n[670.7s - 678.5s] And he has larger shells that are hiding translucent, like light blue wings underneath his back shell.\\n[679.4s -

985.4s] You seem to be rather presentary individual.\\n[985.7s - 987.0s] Oh goodness.\\n[990.0s - 992.1s] He's not always this chili in the west.\\n[992.7s - 1001.3s] And I go over to Sir Dante and I take out my bladed fan and I just start helping him fan the flames just a little bit.\\n[1001.9s - 1007.2s] And what you see is like a stacked, caked up fawn.\\n[1007.5s - 1007.9s] Let's go.\\n[1009.3s - 1010.4s] She is curvy.\\n[1010.8s - 1015.4s] She has kind of like a light dusty rose fur tint to her.\\n[1015.7s - 1019.9s] And even though she is a fawn, she has bunny ears almost like a jackalope.\\n[1020.6s - 1032.6s] And she has really like strappy leather armor and a little like cropped leather jacket that barely covers anything, but she goes as she covers up.\\n[1033.3s -

1095.4s] All right, so you're quite familiar.\\n[1095.6s - 1104.2s] It is a very land suffused with the natural magics of the realm.\\n[1104.6s - 1115.3s] Here, Andra, herself, her will exists towards the center lock that holds the life force and energy of the massive forest.\\n[1116.6s - 1118.4s] So you're of Andrus folk.\\n[1119.0s - 1122.3s] Well, then, perhaps not much of this will be a surprise to you then.\\n[1122.5s - 1128.1s] But just know that natural magics of the world can be also rather tricksy.\\n[1128.4s - 1130.5s] There's a reason I didn't build deeper into the forest.\\n[1130.7s - 1131.4s] I like it out here.\\n[1131.6s - 1141.4s] It's close enough to keep it interesting, but also far enough away where I don't get too caught up with the tricksters of the wood.\\n[1142.1s - 1149.8s] Though, um, as some of the grove children came by speaking up a mighty storm, not but a couple days ago.\\n[1150.9s - 1152.3s] Isn't that who we were looking for?\\n[1153.0s - 1154.9s] You ran into the grove children.\\n[1155.8s - 1163.8s] As we do that, we shift into a brief flashback, not but a day before within the city of Fort Overmarsh.\\n[1163.9s - 1172.6s] Here, the once militaristic outpost that in peacetime has kind of taken on a new form as a trading outpost.\\n[1173.4s - 1179.8s] Ways to the south of the Emerald Sky, the bustle of the townsfolk are walking through the space.\\n[1180.3s - 1185.1s] There's two open mines, one that's kind of falling out of use, while one has been discovered is building up.\\n[1185.7s - 1192.2s] You have stumbled into the town and made your relatively unseen or uncared for position in this city.\\n[1192.4s - 1197.4s] What are you all doing here in Fort Overmarsh at the moment in this flashback?\\n\n"
